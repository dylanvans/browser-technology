	<h1>Details - Summary</h1>
	<details>
		<summary>The Achaemenid Empire, also called the (First) Persian Empire, was an empire based in Western Asia, founded by Cyrus the Great.</summary>
		<p>Ranging at its greatest extent from the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper in the west to the Indus Valley in the east, it was one of the largest empires in history, spanning 5.5 million square kilometers, and was larger than any previous empire in history. It is equally notable for its successful model of a centralised, bureaucratic administration (through satraps under the King of Kings), for building infrastructure such as road systems and a postal system, the use of an official language across its territories, and the development of civil services and a large professional army.</p>
